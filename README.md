That's my approach of doing things in Advent of Code 2023 edition.
Enjoy if You want, comments are welcome if You can help me to get better, more optimal and correct my mistakes!

The repo will be split into particulars days which will be inserted as directories.
Every challenge will have the Markdown file with the tasks (both, part one and part two), personal input generated for the challenge also will be included.

Stay sharp!
